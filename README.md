# LowCostSensorProcessing

This repository contains the code for an IDEAS citizen science project analysis done by Anastasia Montgomery, in conjunction with the Center for Spatial Data Science (CSDS) at the University of Chicago. Within this repository, we contain code to analyze PurpleAir and EPA PM2.5 concentrations over a 21-county domain and Cook County. 

## Code

The code for analysis available within CitizenSci_final_colab.ipynb

Several Python libraries are required for this code: figures were made using Matplotlib, the map projections used Cartopy, the shapefiles were manipulated using Geopandas and Shapely, and the mathematical calculations were made using Numpy and Scipy.

## Data Availability

The EPA PM2.5 data is available to download here: https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/airdata/hourly_88101_2020.zip

The PurpleAir data is available to download here: https://map.purpleair.com/1/mPM25/a60/p604800/cC0#8.69/41.8674/-87.5243

The shapefiles used for figure creation is available within this repository in LowCostSensorProcessing/data
